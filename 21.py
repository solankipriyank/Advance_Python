'''What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java'''


 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods or functions). The main principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Here's a brief explanation of each:

    Encapsulation: This is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class.
    It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes the necessary functionalities.

    Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class can inherit properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class.
    It promotes code reusability and allows the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

    Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability to take on different forms.
    In OOP, it refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same message (method call) in different ways.
    Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

    Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
    It allows the programmer to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

    Regarding your question about multiple inheritance in Java:

    No, Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes, meaning a Java class cannot directly inherit from more than one class.
    This decision was made to avoid the complexities and ambiguities that multiple inheritance can introduce, such as the diamond problem.

    However, Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces.
    A Java class can implement multiple interfaces, which allows it to inherit method signatures from multiple sources while avoiding the complications of inheriting state and implementation from multiple classes.
    This approach maintains the benefits of multiple inheritance while avoiding some of its pitfalls.
